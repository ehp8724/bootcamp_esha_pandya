# Stakeholder Memo: Counterparty Credit Risk Monthly Reporting

**To:** Chief Risk Officer (CRO)  
**From:** Risk Analytics Team  
**Date:** 20Aug25
**Subject:** Problem Framing & Scoping for CCR Monthly Reporting Tool  

### Problem
Current counterparty credit risk (CCR) reporting is manual and prone to delays. Regulators (Basel III/IV) require accurate monthly reporting of exposures and capital requirements, and the CRO needs timely oversight to manage firm-wide risk.  

### Stakeholder & Users
- **Stakeholder:** Chief Risk Officer (CRO)  
- **Users:** Risk Analysts  

### Useful Answer
We propose a reporting tool that calculates **Exposure at Default (EAD)** and **Probability of Default (PD)**, and produces a **monthly table of counterparties** with their capital requirements.  

### Assumptions
- Exposure data and credit ratings are available at month-end.  
- Basel capital rules can be consistently applied across all counterparties.  
- The report can be generated within regulatory deadlines.  

### Risks
- Missing or outdated exposure or PD data.  
- Regulatory changes that require formula updates.  

### Next Steps  
- Collect month-end exposure and credit data.  
- Implement EAD Ã— PD calculations and monthly reporting format.
